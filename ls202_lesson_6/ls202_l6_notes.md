##### LS202 HTML and CSS > Lesson 6: Advanced Layout

## 1. Introduction

#### What to Focus On

In this lesson, we'll take a whirlwind tour of some layout-related features of CSS: floats, positioning, flex, grid, CSS frameworks, and responsive design. None of these topics are easy; in fact, unlike most of our material here at Launch School, **we don't expect you to master them in this lesson**. Instead, familiarize yourself with the concepts and what you can do with them, then use Google and MDN when you need to use them. Master the material we discussed in the previous lessons, but leave advanced layout until you're ready to use it. Don't struggle. When you've had more experience, you will get a better handle on the subject.  

For now, you should know how to use the following in simple projects and problem sets:  

* floated elements, including how to clear floats
* positioning with `position: absolute`
* basic media queries
* liquid and fluid layouts
